![P1-Extender-Board](https://github.com/macsnoeren/P1-Extender/blob/main/Hardware/v1.1/P1_Extender_Board_v1.1.png)

## Need your smart meter P1 port far away?
When you charging point is far away from your smartmeter and it needs a P1 poort connection to perform load balancing AND you are not able to use long wires? Than you can use this P1 extender. It connects with the network or Internet and read the messages from your smart meter (using another smart meter P1 reader). It provide these messages similarly to the smart meter. Just connect your charger point to this remote P1 port and it will get the P1 messages.

The hardware and software simulate a smart meter P1 port.
